# Daikon Gradle Plugin

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-apache%202.0-blue.svg)](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

This Gradle plug-in creates a task, `daikonRun`, that runs [Daikon](https://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/) on Java projects' unit tests.

## Configuration

To use this plug-in, you must specify the location where the plugin can find Daikon.

In the following example, Daikon is in a project's `libs` directory: 

```groovy
runDaikon {
    // the project directory where daikon.jar, ChicoryPremain.jar,
    // and dcomp_*.jar files exist  
    requires = file("libs")
}
```

Also, you should specific both the Daikon output directory and the test driver package.

You can find an example of this configuration below:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'maven-publish'
    id 'com.sri.gradle.daikon' version '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'
}

repositories {
    mavenLocal()
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url 'https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/'
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:28.0-jre'
    testImplementation 'org.hamcrest:hamcrest:2.2'
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13'
}
```

```groovy
runDaikon {
    outputDir = file("${projectDir}/build/daikon-output")
    // the project directory where daikon.jar, ChicoryPremain.jar,
    // and dcomp_*.jar files exist  
    requires = file("libs")
    // *TestDriver package name
    // If you use Randoop, then Randoop will generate this TestDriver for you.
    testDriverPackage = "com.foo"
    // However, if you are not using Randoop, then you need a TestDriver.
    // This TestDriver should have a static void main method, so Daikon can
    // executed. Having said that, this plugin will automatically generate
    // this TestDriver for you.
}
```

## Using a locally-built plugin

You can build the plugin locally rather than downloading it from Maven Central.

To build the plugin from source, run `./gradlew build`.

If you want to use a locally-built version of the plugin, you can publish the plugin to your
local Maven repository by running `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`. Then, add the following to
the `settings.gradle` file in the Gradle project that you want to use the plugin:

```
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}
```
