# Daikon Gradle Plugin
(experimental) daikon gradle plugin

This Gradle plug-in creates a task to run [Daikon](https://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/) on Java projects.

## Configuration

To use this plug-in, [you must have downloaded Daikon and have it as dependency](https://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/).

### Configuring your project

Add the plug-in dependency and apply it to the root project's `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'maven-publish'
    id 'com.sri.gradle.daikon' version '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

Make sure you have also declared the following repositories and dependencies on your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenLocal()
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url 'https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/'
    }
}

dependencies { 
    implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:28.0-jre'
    testImplementation 'org.hamcrest:hamcrest:2.2'
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13'
}
```

Note: The Daikon Gradle Plugin uses Guava's immutable collection classes. 


### Configuring the Daikon plugin

In the `build.gradle` of the project that applies the plugin:

```groovy
runDaikon {
    outputDir = file("${projectDir}/build/daikon-output")
    // the project directory where daikon.jar, ChicoryPremain.jar,
    // and dcomp_*.jar files exist  
    requires = file("libs")
    // *TestDriver package name
    // This TestDriver was generated by Randoop 
    testDriverPackage = "com.foo"
}
```

Your `settings.gradle` file must contain:

```
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}
```

## Task

* `daikonRun` - runs Daikon workflow'.
